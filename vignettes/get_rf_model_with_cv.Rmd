# Introduction

The `get_rf_model_with_cv` function implements a random forest-based modeling pipeline with cross-validation to assess model performance. It includes optional undersampling for handling imbalanced data and provides detailed metrics for evaluating model accuracy.

# Function Overview

```r
get_rf_model_with_cv <- function(Data,
                                 Undersample = FALSE,
                                 best.m = NULL, # any numeric value or call function to get it
                                 testReps, # testReps must be at least 2;
                                 Type) {
  ...
}
```
# Purpose

This function:

- Builds a random forest model using the `randomForest` package.
- Performs cross-validation to evaluate model metrics.
- Optionally applies undersampling to balance datasets.
- Returns aggregated performance metrics.

# Parameters

| Parameter   | Type          | Description                                                                 |
|-------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Data`      | Data Frame    | Input dataset. Must include a `Target_Organ` column as the response variable.|
| `Undersample` | Logical      | If `TRUE`, balances the dataset by undersampling the majority class.         |
| `best.m`    | Numeric/NULL  | Number of predictors sampled at each split. If `NULL`, default is used.      |
| `testReps`  | Integer       | Number of cross-validation folds (must be >= 2).                             |
| `Type`      | Numeric       | Type of importance metric (`1` for Mean Decrease Accuracy, `2` for Gini).    |

# Outputs

The function returns a list containing:

1. `performance_metrics`: Aggregated performance metrics including sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy.
2. `raw_results`: Raw data of sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for each cross-validation fold.

# Cross-Validation Workflow

## Data Preparation

- Splits data into training and testing subsets based on the specified `testReps`.
- Optionally applies undersampling to balance the training set.

## Model Training

- Trains a random forest model using the `randomForest` package.

## Prediction and Metrics Calculation

- Predicts probabilities on the test set.
- Computes metrics (sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, etc.) using the `caret` package.

## Performance Summary

- Aggregates performance metrics across cross-validation folds.

# Example Usage

```r
# Load necessary libraries
library(randomForest)
library(caret)

# Example dataset
data(Data)
Data$Target_Organ <- ifelse(iris$Species == "setosa", 1, 0)

# Run the function
results <- get_rf_model_with_cv(Data = iris[, -5], 
                                Undersample = TRUE, 
                                best.m = 2, 
                                testReps = 5, 
                                Type = 2)

# Print results
print(results$performance_metrics)
```
# Conclusion
The get_rf_model_with_cv function is a powerful tool for evaluating random forest models with cross-validation, especially for datasets with class imbalance. Adjust parameters such as Undersample and best.m to optimize performance for your specific dataset.
