# Function Purpose

The `get_repeat_dose_parallel_studyids` function is designed to retrieve study IDs from a database that correspond to parallel-design studies involving repeat-dose toxicity. It filters the studies based on the specified design and whether the species involved are rats.

# Input Parameters

The function accepts the following parameters:

| **Parameter**             | **Description**                                                                                          | **Default Value** |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| `path_db`                 | The file path to the SQLite database. It must be provided as a valid string.                             | **Required**      |
| `rat_studies`             | A logical flag indicating whether to filter the studies for rats only. Defaults to `FALSE`.              | `FALSE`           |

# Output

The function returns a vector of study IDs that meet the specified criteria. The returned vector contains the following:

- **Study IDs**: A list of study IDs that match both the parallel design and repeat-dose toxicity criteria (and rat species, if specified).

# Key Steps

1. **Database Existence Check**:  
   The function first checks if the database file exists at the provided path. If not, an error is raised.

2. **Database Connection**:  
   The database connection is established using the `sendigR` package. A connection to the database is initialized using `sendigR::initEnvironment()`.

3. **Retrieve Parallel Study IDs**:  
   The function uses `sendigR::getStudiesSDESIGN()` to retrieve all study IDs associated with the parallel design.

4. **Retrieve Repeat-Dose Studies**:  
   A SQL query is executed via `sendigR::genericQuery()` to fetch study IDs that are associated with repeat-dose toxicity. This query looks for studies with specific `TSPARMCD` values related to repeat-dose toxicity.

5. **Intersect Parallel and Repeat-Dose Studies**:  
   The study IDs obtained from the parallel design and the repeat-dose toxicity studies are intersected to identify common study IDs.

6. **Optionally Filter for Rat Studies**:  
   If `rat_studies = TRUE`, the function retrieves study IDs that involve rats as the species. This is done by querying the `SPECIES` field in the database and filtering based on the presence of "RAT".

7. **Return Study IDs**:  
   The final result is a vector of study IDs that meet the filter conditions, including parallel design, repeat-dose toxicity, and optionally, rat species.

# Example Usage

```r
# Example without filtering for rat studies
study_ids <- get_repeat_dose_parallel_studyids(path_db = "path/to/database.sqlite")

# Example with filtering for rat studies
study_ids_rats <- get_repeat_dose_parallel_studyids(path_db = "path/to/database.sqlite", rat_studies = TRUE)
