## Function Overview

The `get_liver_om_lb_mi_tox_score_list` function calculates a series of liver organ toxicity scores, body weight z-scores, and other relevant metrics for a set of studies or XPT files. It outputs results based on user preferences for individual scores, z-scores by USUBJID, or averaged scores for multiple studies. This function also manages data flow through several steps, including fetching and processing data, calculating scores, and managing error handling.

### Function Signature

```r
get_liver_om_lb_mi_tox_score_list(
  studyid_or_studyids = FALSE,
  path_db,
  fake_study = FALSE,
  use_xpt_file = FALSE,
  output_individual_scores = FALSE,
  output_zscore_by_USUBJID = FALSE
)
```
## Function Overview

`get_liver_om_lb_mi_tox_score_list` is an R function designed to process liver toxicity scores from one or more studies. The function calculates several scores related to liver toxicity and body weight, including:

- **Body Weight Z-Score (BWZSCORE_avg)**
- **Liver Organ to Body Weight Z-Score (liverToBW_avg)**
- **LB Score (LB_score_avg)**
- **MI Score (MI_score_avg)**

The function can output individual scores, z-scores by USUBJID, or averaged scores. It also includes error handling to capture and record any issues during processing.

## Arguments

- `studyid_or_studyids` (Character vector or a single study ID): 
  A character vector containing one or more study IDs to process. If multiple studies are provided, the function processes each study sequentially.

- `path_db` (Character): 
  Path to the database or directory containing the data files.

- `fake_study` (Logical, default: `FALSE`): 
  A boolean flag indicating if the study data is simulated (`TRUE`) or real (`FALSE`).

- `use_xpt_file` (Logical, default: `FALSE`): 
  A boolean flag indicating whether to use an XPT file for the study data. Default is `FALSE`.

- `output_individual_scores` (Logical, default: `FALSE`): 
  A boolean flag indicating whether individual scores should be returned. Default is `FALSE`.

- `output_zscore_by_USUBJID` (Logical, default: `FALSE`): 
  A boolean flag indicating whether to output z-scores by `USUBJID`. Default is `FALSE`.

## Details

The function iterates over each study ID or XPT folder and processes the data to calculate various toxicity scores. Key calculation blocks include:

- **Fetching Master Compile Data**: 
  The function calls `get_compile_data` to retrieve the primary data for each study.

- **Body Weight Z-Score Calculation**: 
  Using the `get_bw_score` function, the body weight z-scores are calculated either individually or averaged.

- **Liver Organ to Body Weight Z-Score Calculation**: 
  Using the `get_livertobw_score` function, liver toxicity scores related to body weight are calculated.

- **LB Score Calculation**: 
  The `get_lb_score` function is used to calculate LB scores.

- **MI Score Calculation**: 
  The `get_mi_score` function is used for MI score calculation.

## Key Calculation Blocks

1. **Fetching Master Compile Data**:  
   This block calls the `get_compile_data` function to retrieve the primary data for each study. This data is essential for subsequent calculations.

2. **Body Weight Z-Score Calculation**:  
   The body weight z-scores are calculated using the `get_bw_score` function, and the result is either returned as individual scores or averaged scores.

3. **Liver Organ to Body Weight Z-Score Calculation**:  
   The liver organ-to-body weight z-scores are calculated using the `get_livertobw_score` function.

4. **LB Score Calculation**:  
   The `get_lb_score` function is called to calculate the LB score for each study.

5. **MI Score Calculation**:  
   The function calculates the MI score using the `get_mi_score` function.

## Error Handling

Each calculation block is wrapped in a `tryCatch` statement to handle any errors encountered during execution. If any block fails, the study ID is added to an error list, and the function continues processing the next study.

## Return Value

The function returns different outputs based on the flags passed:

- If `output_individual_scores = TRUE`: The function returns a combined data frame with individual scores for each study.
  
- If `output_zscore_by_USUBJID = TRUE`: The function returns a data frame with z-scores by `USUBJID` for each study.

- If neither flag is set, the function returns a data frame with averaged scores for each study.

## Example 1: Get Averaged Scores for a Single Study

In this example, we call the `get_liver_om_lb_mi_tox_score_list` function to retrieve averaged scores for a single study. The `studyid_or_studyids` argument is set to a single study ID, and the `path_db` argument points to the location of the database.

```{r}
#result <- get_liver_om_lb_mi_tox_score_list(
  #studyid_or_studyids = "Study_001",
  #path_db = "path/to/database"
#)
```
